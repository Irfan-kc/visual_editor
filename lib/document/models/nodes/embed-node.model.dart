// An embed node inside of a line in a Quill document.
// Embed node is a leaf node similar to [Text].
// It represents an arbitrary piece of non-textual doc-tree embedded into a document, such as, image,
// horizontal rule, video, or any other object with defined structure, like a tweet, for instance.
// Embed node's length is always `1` character and it is represented with
// unicode object replacement character in the document text.
// Any inline style can be applied to an embed, however this does not
// necessarily mean the embed will look according to that style.
// For instance, applying "bold" style to an image gives no effect, while adding a "link" to
// an image actually makes the image react to user's action.
