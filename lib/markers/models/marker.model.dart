  // We need ids, otherwise we don't have a reliable means of deleting
  // arbitrary markers from a stack of markers that share the same text span.
  // We would be forced to delete only markers from the top.
  // Without the id a client developer would have to navigate by himself
  // to the marker node that he needs to delete (which is not fun).
  // (!) If you need to link one object to multiple marker consider
  // using the data attribute as a shared identifier.
  // Markers with the same id will be considered a single marker even though they are positioned in different parts of the document.
  // Because of this they will react at the same time during interactions (hover, delete, etc.)

  // Let's assume you want to link the profile of a particular user to one or more arbitrary markers
  // (for example to render a user card on top of the marker on hovering).
  // The "data" attribute stores custom params as desired by the client app (uuid or serialised json data).
  // It's up to the client app to decide how to use the data attribute.
  // One idea is to use UUIDs that point to separate objects which provide additional info for a marker.
  // For example a developer might want to render a bunch of statistics (or an user profile)
  // that are repeating on a large set of the markers of the app.
  // Therefore instead of repeating the same data inline in the entire doc it's better to reference these values from a separate list.
  // In this case using the data to store an UUID for the descriptor object will be enough.
  // On the other hand, if the dev knows that most of the markers will have few
  // and unique attributes than he can store the attributes in the "data" attribute itself.
  // The "data" attribute will be returned by the callbacks methods invoked on hover and tap.
  // Multiple markers can use the same "data" values to trigger the same common behaviours.
  // In essence there are many ways this attribute can be put to good use.
  // It's also possible not to use it at all and just render highlights that don't have any unique data assigned.
